I'm currently studying Software Engineering with a clear goal in mind: to become a skilled full-stack developer. I'm fluent in English and constantly expanding my HTML and CSS skills. While I'm still getting the hang of JavaScript, I'm actively diving into React.js. I'm on the lookout for any job, freelance or internship opportunities that will help me gain practical experience in this field. I'm a team player, hardworking, and quick to pick up new skills—all qualities I'm eager to bring to your team.
